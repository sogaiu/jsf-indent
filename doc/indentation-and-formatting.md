# Indentation and Formatting

To reduce potential confusion, the following is an attempt to
distinguish the terms "indentation" and "formatting" a bit.

Formatting tends to be applied to a file or per top-level form.
Indentation tends to be a per-line operation.

When indentation occurs, the changes are local and few.  Compared to
formatting an entire file or buffer, "taking in" the changes is spread
out over time.

Formatting an entire file or buffer tends to present a situation where
either one does not review all of the changes or one is faced with the
task of going through changes across the target range all at once.

[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29638007/indentation-of-lisp-code/29643315#29643315) is another attempt at making a distinction.
